## Window Location

The `window.location` object can be used to get information on the current page address (URL) and to redirect the browser to a new page.


The `window.location` object can be written without the `window` prefix, as just `location`.

#### Some examples:

- `window.location.href` returns the href (URL) of the current page
- `window.location.hostname` returns the domain name of the web host
- `window.location.host` returns both the host name and any associated port
- `window.location.pathname` returns the path and filename of the current page
- `window.location.protocol` returns the web protocol used (http: or https:)
- `window.location.assign()` loads a new document
