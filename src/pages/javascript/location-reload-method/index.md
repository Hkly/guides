## Location Reload Method

`location.reload()` reloads the page from the current URL. 

It takes an optional boolean parameter. When set to `true`, the page will reload from the server. When unset, or set to `false`, the page may be reloaded from cache, depending on the browser. 

#### Example:

```javascript
location.reload(true);
```
This will reload the page at the current URL from the server.
